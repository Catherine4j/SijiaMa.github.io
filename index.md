# Nice to meet you

I'm an Assistant Professor of Information Management in the Department of Management, Tilburg University, the Netherlands.

I received my Ph.D. in Management Science and Information Systems from Guanghua School of Management, Peking University, China.

My current research interest lies in sharing economy, e-commerce, and social media.
